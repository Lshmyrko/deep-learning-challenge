# deep-learning-challenge

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using neural networks to predict the success of funding applicants for Alphabet Soup, a charitable organization. The model aims to classify whether an applicant will be successful (1) or not (0) based on various input features.

Results:
Data Preprocessing:
Target Variable:

The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, indicating whether the funding application was successful.
Feature Variables:

Features include various columns such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
Variables Removed:

Columns 'EIN' and 'NAME' were removed as they don't contribute to the prediction.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:

The model consists of an input layer with the number of neurons equal to the transformed shape of the input data, a hidden layer with 80 neurons and 'relu' activation, another hidden layer with 30 neurons and 'relu' activation, and an output layer with 1 neuron and 'sigmoid' activation.
The choice of neurons and layers is based on experimentation and common practices in neural network design.
Achieving Target Model Performance:

The model achieved an accuracy of around 72.5%, which is below the target performance of 75%.
Steps Taken for Performance Improvement:

Adjusted dropout rates.
Changed layer sizes.
Modified learning rates.
Experimented with different activation functions.
Trained for more epochs.
Attempted feature engineering.
Summary:
The deep learning model, while showing some predictive power, did not meet the target performance of 75%. Further experimentation and feature engineering could be explored to enhance model performance.

Recommendation for a Different Model:
Considering the challenges faced in achieving the target performance with a neural network, an alternative approach could involve using an ensemble of models. Combining different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or a combination of these, might provide better performance and robustness for this classification problem. Ensemble methods often handle complex relationships in data effectively and can offer improved generalization. Additionally, tuning hyperparameters for these ensemble methods could contribute to better results.
